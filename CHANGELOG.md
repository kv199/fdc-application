# Changelog

All user-facing changes to FDC are listed here, newest release first. The
format and rules are described in [Releasing FDC](docs/releasing.md#changelog).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Driver Analysis**: corner statistics now show how much of the cornering
  time the front and rear tires spent above 100% slip, the level at which the
  in-game tire friction telemetry turns red, instead of a front-versus-rear
  comparison that read above 90% for almost every recording.

## 7.16.48 - 2026-09-25

First public release of FDC.

- **HUD**: tire temperatures, throttle and brake, steering, gear, speed and
  RPM, boost, power and torque, and an eight-second input graph, in one panel
  or as freely placed blocks.
- **Shift Light**: per-gear shift points learned for each car and tune, with a
  red approach cue and a purple optimal shift cue.
- **Events**: a local event library with run recording, lap and sector times,
  top-down traces, and a live Delta against the fastest saved run.
- **Driver Analysis** (beta): recorded asphalt sessions that report the
  dominant recurring problem.
- **Garage**: automatic vehicle library with class, PI, and drivetrain
  configurations.
